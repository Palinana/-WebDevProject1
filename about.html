                Freddie Mercury (Farrokh Bulsara) was born on the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar. 
                His parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara, sent him off to a private school in India, 
                from 1955 til 1963. In 1964, he and his family flew to England. In 1966 he 
                started his education at the Ealing College of Art, where he graduated in 1969. 
                He loved art, and because of that, he often went along with his friend Tim 
                Staffell, who played in a band called Smile. Also in this band where Brian May 
                and Roger Taylor.

                When Staffell left the band in 1970, Mercury became their new singer. He changed
                the band's name into Queen, and they took on a new bass-player in February 1971, 
                called John Deacon. Their first album, "Queen", came out in 1973. But their real 
                breakthrough was "Killer Queen", on the album "Sheer Heart Attack", which was 
                released in 1974. They became immortal with the single "Bohemian Rhapsody", on 
                the 1975 album "A Night At The Opera".

                After their biggest hit in the USA in 1980 with "Another One Bites The Dust", 
                they had a bad period. Their next, the disco-oriented "Hot Space", was hated 
                not only by rock critics but also by many hardcore fans. Only the song "Under 
                Pressure", which they sang together with David Bowie, made a difference.  In 1983, 
                they took a year off. But, in 1984 they came back with their new album called 
                "The Works". In April 1985, Mercury released his first solo album, the less 
                rock-oriented and more dance-oriented "Mr. Bad Guy". The album is often 
                considered now to have been a flop, but it actually wasn't.

                After 1986, it went silent around Queen. In 1987, he was diagnosed with AIDS 
                but he kept working at a pace. After Mercury told the band, he refused to talk 
                about it anymore. He was afraid that people would buy their records out of pity. 
                He said he wanted to keep making music as long as possible. And he did. After 
                "The Miracle", Mercury's health got worse. They wanted to do one more album, called 
                "Innuendo." They worked on it in 1990 and early 1991. Every time when Mercury would 
                feel well, he came over to the studio and sang. Mercury's final video clip was 
                released in June 1991. The clip, "These Are The Days Of Our Lives", later turned out 
                to be his goodbye song, the last time he appeared on film. Mercury told the world about
                his disease, one day before he passed on. His death was seen as a great loss for the 
                world of popular music.
